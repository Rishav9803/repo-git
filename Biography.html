    <h3>Early life</h3>
    
    <p>Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada was born as Abhay Charan De on 1 September 1896 in Calcutta, India.[1] He was also called Nandulāl. His father was Gour Mohan De, who worked as a cloth merchant, and his mother was Rajani De.[15] Consistent with Bengali traditions, Abhay Charan's parents invited an astrologer to predict his horoscope.[15] The astrologer professed to De's family that later in his life, Abhay would become "a great exponent of religion."[15] Abhay grew up in a Vaishnav home and his father was devote in his spiritual practices.[15] Gaur Mohan regularly took Abhay to the Radha-Govinda temple as a child. Later in life, Prabhupad fondly remembers the murtis of that temple.[15]

        Abhay Charan studied at the Scottish Church College.[1] During his first year, his family arranged for him to be married to Radharani Datta.[15] Until completing his fourth year in college, Abhay lived with his family and Radharani lived with hers.[15] In 1920, Abhay chose not to accept his graduation diploma after completing his fourth year, in support of the national movement occurring in India at the time.[15] The national movement advocated for national schools and self government (as opposed to British rule of India).[15]
        
        After completing his education, Abhay started working at Bose's Laboratory as a department manager in Calcutta, India.[15]</p>
